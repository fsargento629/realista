Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv
- Simple quizz website that prompts user with houses from lisbon and asks for the price

## TODO:

### Priority

- Map as the first image (generated by JS)
- Next house button
- Run game until you miss too many. Print the score after

### Near future plans

- Scrape address as well (using lat and lon)
- Several more pages: about, etc
- Hints (they are perishable)
- Better prompts



### Long term plans

- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server (Ihave already bought www.realista.pt)
- Or maybe deploy it to heroku ?
