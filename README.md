# realista

Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price 

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv

## TODO:

### Priority


- Change main function to start and API after reading database
- Make a simple website that uses the API and prints the result


### Near future plans

- Get link from scraper as well
- Save images (or image links from each listing)

### Long term plans

- Frontend in React to call api
- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server (Ihave already bought www.realista.pt)
