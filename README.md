Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price 

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv

## TODO:

### Priority


- Write the Go API. A function that collects a random question from an sql database and returns it
- Refactor the scraper to build sql database



### Near future plans

- Get link from scraper as well
- Save images (or image links from each listing)

### Long term plans
- Frontend in React to call api
- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server
