Webscraper for supercasa.pt written in go (WIP)

## TODO:

### Priority

- property id as a uint, not string
- func to get area and E rating from features string
- Iterate through all of lisbon (maybe just each neighbourhood?)

### Near future plans

- Investigate analytics options in go (or maybe just use python)
### Long term plans

- Use plotly and dash to deploy analytics
