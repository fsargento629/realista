Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv
- Simple quizz website that prompts user with houses from lisbon and asks for the price

## TODO:

### Priority

- Check price function refactor: make it have a limit, and a colder/warmer indicator. 
- Also, had a better sucess message (close enough, woow spot on) with the real value after it
- "Next house button" to keep playing


#### Improve frontend to be more user friendly


### Near future plans

- Better check_price, with a limit of tries,  an indications of how wrong you are and better condition for being correct
- More photos



### Long term plans

- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server (Ihave already bought www.realista.pt)
- Or maybe deploy it to heroku ?
