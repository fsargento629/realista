Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price 

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv
- Simple quizz website that prompts user with houses from lisbon and asks for the price

## TODO:

### Priority

#### Improve frontend to be more user friendly

- Units in front of area
- Capitalize bairro
- Prompt in keur

### Near future plans

- Better check_price, with a limit of tries,  an indications of how wrong you are and better condition for being correct
- "Next house button" to keep playing 


### Long term plans

- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server (Ihave already bought www.realista.pt)
- Or maybe deploy it to heroku ?
