Quizz app that prompts listings from the Lisbon house market and asks the user for the price

## Features

- Webscraper for supercasa.com
- Exports to .csv
- Simple quizz website that prompts user with houses from lisbon and asks for the price

## TODO:

### Priority

- Results screen that shows your score 
- Refactor game into a short 5 round game (configurable). At the end the game chnages into ther results screen
- Welcome screen that lets you select the number of rounds and the neighbourhoods, and also the difficulty

### Near future plans

- Scrape address as well (using lat and lon)
- Make it a price is right kind of game
- Several more pages: about, etc
- Hints (they are perishable)
- Better prompts



### Long term plans

- More scrapers: idealista, bpi
- Get a cheap PC to be a server (Ihave already bought www.realista.pt)
- make it multiplayer. Not sure how.
